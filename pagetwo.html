This time round</p><p><em>they have seen it and I am sure they now believe that AFCON is as good as the EURO and even better than the nations league and copa America. We have shown the whole world that football was born in Africa. Nobody will ever question players who play in Europe again.
When a player is called up by his national team,</em> let no one stop them by saying AFCON is nothing."</p>
